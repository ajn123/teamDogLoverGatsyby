## One thing I want to do with this business is:
- Give back to the community
- Give back to the walkers who are the heart and soul of this business
- Give back to the world.

I think it is important to understand that respect, trust, and responsibility go both ways.  It is part of our mission at Team Dog Lover not to have predatory business practices and allow walkers to work on their own schedule and be able to make money on their own time.

In the future, I want to throw pizza parties for all how have made Team Dog Lover successful and prosperous.  

I also think it is important to donate to those in need such as humanitarian aid for Ukraine.

Love,
Alex
