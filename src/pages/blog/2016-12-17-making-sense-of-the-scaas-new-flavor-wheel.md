Dogs are the greatest BFFs for many reasons: They  greet you at the door at the end of a long work day, are always there to listen, chill out and enjoy your company, and drag you (literally and figuratively) along on health-boosting walks. But the reason you love going on those outings isn't just because it makes you feel happyâ€”it's because it makes your pup super happy too.
