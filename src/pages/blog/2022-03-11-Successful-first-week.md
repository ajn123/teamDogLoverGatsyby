# What a great week!
this week was hectic and alot of hard work!  Met with three clients.  Ended up walking a few dogs.  There names were Bruno and Ginger!  Walking dogs has been a very enlightening process and really taught me a lot about myself and how fast life goes by.

Everyone should find time to go outside and take a look around and smell the roses.  Life goes by fast and you may just miss it.
